Shell-I:
* Implement line parsing and word reading (4_36)
    * Create word-list struct and methods for it (try blind typedef)
    * Write line-parsing func (read line, return allocated list), or err&clean
    * Add " processing and errors on imbalance (still req spaces)
    * Write main dialogue cycle
    * Bug: weird characters after first iter
* Add \ as screening symbol for " and for itself (4_37)
* Add empty word impl (4_38)
    * Fix concatenated empty words: should be 1 empty wrd

Shell-II:
* Add prog-executing with wait and status display to prompt (5_15)
    * Add cd command execution: call chdir in parent proc
* Implement no-param cd (chdir to user root) (5_16)

Shell-III:
- Add split-pattern processing to tokenizer
    - Patterns: &, >, <, >>, |, ;, (, ), &&, ||
    - Deal with screening \ logic when right before split-pattern
- Add & processing to cmd execution
    - when & after cmd, run it in the background
    - If anything after &, communicate an error
    - Fix regular proc wait (use wait cycle with pid checking)
