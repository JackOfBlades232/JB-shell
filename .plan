Shell-I:
* Implement line parsing and word reading (4_36)
    * Create word-list struct and methods for it (try blind typedef)
    * Write line-parsing func (read line, return allocated list), or err&clean
    * Add " processing and errors on imbalance (still req spaces)
    * Write main dialogue cycle
    * Bug: weird characters after first iter
* Add \ as screening symbol for " and for itself (4_37)
* Add empty word impl (4_38)
    * Fix concatenated empty words: should be 1 empty wrd

Shell-II:
* Add prog-executing with wait and status display to prompt (5_15)
    * Add cd command execution: call chdir in parent proc
* Implement no-param cd (chdir to user root) (5_16)

Shell-III: (5_17)
* Add split-pattern processing to tokenizer
    * Patterns: &, >, <, >>, |, ;, (, ), &&, ||
    * Deal with screening \ logic when right before split-pattern
* Add & processing to cmd execution
    * remake word_list->argv reading to 1 by 1 (to process & from list)
    * If anything after &, communicate an error
    * when & after cmd, run it in the background
    * Fix regular proc wait (use wait cycle with pid checking)

Shell-IV: (5_19)
* Add split between command processing and spec seps processing, if mingled, err
* Add processing of >, < and >> (redirection of in, out, out+append)

* Implement zombie cleaning on SIGCHLD (5_24)
    * Disable it for wait cycle in non-bg execution of command

Shell-V: (5_30, 5_31)
* Create a command linked list, and it's filling from tokens
    * Implement linked list for commands with functionality
    * Remake execute_cmd command reading to linked list (| = split)
    * Refactor execute_cmd (still execute only the first command)
* Add all processes launching in chain
    * Refactor process launching in execute_command
    * Implement chain io redirection
* Reimplement bg launching
    * Make in_backdround a property of cmd chain
    * Remake wait cycle for non-bg commands
* Split up, clean up and refactor command and execute_command

Shell-edit: (5_36)
* Implement line-input stage before tokenizer
    * Add line input module (repurpose 5_35, no autocomp)
    * Remake tokenizer to buffer parsing
* Implement autocomplete
    * Implement 1-level (non-rec) PATH lookup (only x files)
        * Implement lookup
        * Test validity
        * Deal with duplicate names being looked up
    * Implement fs lookup
        * Implement prefix dirent search 
            * Init: if /, root, ~ - home, else stay;
            * Step: try to find the word till next /
        * Then, use same funcs as with path to parse dir
    * Add constraint for only executables in PATH search
    * Implement completion in string (without choice)
* Add lookup type decision
- Add any type file name autocompletion for fs
    * (Add slash for directories, devices and others that need a slash)
    - Fix autocompletion when not first dir in name
        - Note 1: lookup is allright, prefix copy -- too, then autocompletion
            f-s up the string and screen.
        - Bug: cat't lookup in /

Shell-VI: (5_39)
* Implement separate group for command (all procs in same group)
* If command is not bg, impl setting it's group as current, once done -
    reset it's own
* Fix bug: now close additional descriptors in group leader, not in main proc

Shell-VII: (5_40)
- Rename command chain to something referring to pipe and create command chain
    entity that would be used to (conditionally) chain commands
- Separate command interpreter from prompt (takes string, performs action)
- Add &&, ||, ; chaining of commands
- Add () for recursive calls to the command interpreter as proc
- Reimplement & as a chain-level separator for launching first prog in bg
    and second in fg
