Shell-I:
* Implement line parsing and word reading (4_36)
    * Create word-list struct and methods for it (try blind typedef)
    * Write line-parsing func (read line, return allocated list), or err&clean
    * Add " processing and errors on imbalance (still req spaces)
    * Write main dialogue cycle
    * Bug: weird characters after first iter
* Add \ as screening symbol for " and for itself (4_37)
- Add empty word impl (4_38)
    - Fix concatenated empty words: should be 1 empty wrd
